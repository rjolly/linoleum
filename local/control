Description: Java desktop environment and software distribution
 This projects allows you to do your daily work from inside the JVM - just like
 Java is your operating system. Your usual Linux workflow is preserved, with
 apt-get install some-library, make and run replaced by install maven
 dependencies, build with Javascript and run - in a everything runs in the same
 JVM philosophy. In addition, the projects brings an API for third-party
 applications. Once your project builds against this API, it can be published in
 Maven, and becomes available as a market application - like in Android. But
 unlike with Android's market, with Maven, dependency management is properly
 done, and not everything is repackaged again in every new application, saving
 lots of space. Already existing applications include a file manager, script
 shell, web and e-mail, pdf viewer and open street map. Hence, the project
 bridges a gap between Linux and Java, aleviating the need to repackage every
 single Java project to make it available in Linux. Already repackaged
 applications can help though, especially the ones with binary hooks, and this
 is where Linux can make a difference, in terms of Java extensibility - think
 bluetooth, media or java3d for instance - each of which a whole separate topic.
 Lastly, Linoleum has the bootstrap property, meaning it can build itself, just
 like the Linux kernel, but unlike Android, which can not be used to develop
 itself.
